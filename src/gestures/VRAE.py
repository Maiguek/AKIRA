# I wanna do a long recording of myself, talking.
# I will split the recordings and get what I am saying plus the positions.
# I could make a 30 min talk, and then split it into 10 second sample frames.

# Then, I want to combine a VAE with an xLSTM.

# Such that, given some text, I can retreive some sequence of positions.

# For the moment, Akira does not need this. (Random movements are sufficient for the current project)
# But I want to play around with this :D
