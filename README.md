## Project Overview

_Note: This project is also being documented in YouTube, please check it out: https://www.youtube.com/@maiguek-516_

**Akira’s Journey** is an ongoing research project for my Bachelor's Thesis focused on understanding our perception of being human. Akira, a humanoid robot, is built using plenty of open-source projects, including the Inmoov project (designed by Gael Langevin), Llma 3.2 3B from Meta, etc.

This project aims to create a robot capable of engaging in natural and expressive conversations to a certain extent, and will be tested against participants in order to do have interactions with them and analyze how these go. This research has a big focus on qualitative analysis.

## Who is Akira?

Akira is a humanoid robot created using open source projects such as Inmoov Project (body), Llama 3.2 3B (language capabilities), F5-TTS (voice cloning), BLIP (image description), and Whisper from Open AI (speech recognition). 

Akira runs on a Jetson Orin Nano Super from Nvidia. And runs everything locally.

Akira also has a silicone face made by hand, which resembles my face. He also uses a fake wig, and it is powered by a 5V 60 Amph SMPS tuned at 6.23V. 

Akira has 2 Arduino Mega boards, which are the ones that control the servomotors for the whole body.

Akira has 42 servomotors, from which right now I am only using 28 (10 for each arm (shoulder + bicep + hand), 3 for the neck, 1 for the jaw, and 4 for the eyelids).

Akira has a wireless microphone K80C1 CKOKC, Waveshare USB to audio adapter and 2 5V 8Ohm speakers, 10-port RSHTECH USB 3.2 hUB, and 2 cameras OV5693/IMX258 4K 12MP.

_Note: Akira is far away of being perfect either by its physical structure or its conversational skills, and that is what makes it perfect for my study jeje._
